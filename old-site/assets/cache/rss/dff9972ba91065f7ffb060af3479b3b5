<strong>Report Date:</strong> 2016-November-08<br />
<strong>Fixed Date:</strong> 2016-November-12<br />
<br />
<strong>Description</strong><br />
The following components distributed with all versions of MODX Evolution (and 0.9.x) contain a vulnerability, that allows remote code execution: Ajaxsearch, eForm and evoGallery<br />
<br />
<strong>Affected Releases</strong><br />
All MODX 0.9.x/Evolution releases prior to and including MODX Evolution 1.1 (with AjaxSearch, eForm or evoGallery installed) are affected.<br />
<br />
<strong>Solution</strong><br />
Determine if site is compromised. Remove any malicious files or database entries. Then, upgrade to MODX Evolution 1.2 or above. See instructions below.<br />
<br />
<strong>Support</strong><br />
If you do not know how to upgrade your site and complete the steps below to locate and remove malicious files and database entries, there are options. You can contact the developer or builder of your site, ask for help in the <a href="https://forums.modx.com/board/48/evo-discussions-support" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MODX Forums</a>, find a <a href="https://modx.com/professionals" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MODX Professional</a> or get help from the <a href="https://modx.com/services/#engage" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MODX Services team</a>.<br />
<br />
One way to determine if your site has been compromised is a new tool called <a href="https://github.com/extras-evolution/evocheck" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Evocheck</a> . It can help identify malicious code in files or database. We recommend using it or a similar tool in case your site has been compromised. And even after your site is secured again, this tool can be useful to find any text/code in your installation. <br />
<br />
Please note, no detection script is perfect and exploits may change over time to hide from such detection.<br />
<strong>Cleaning and Upgrade Instructions for Compromised Installation:</strong><br />
<br />
<ol class="dis-ol">   <br />
<li>Logout from manager</li>
<li><a href="https://modx.com/download/evolution/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Download latest MODX 1.2</a></li>
<li>Upload package to your server via FTP, explicitly overwrite any existing file</li>
<li>Delete file cache/siteCache.idx.php manually by hand via FTP (<em>do NOT rely on &quot;Clear Cache&quot;-button inside manager</em>), because there is a malicious Plugin likely hidden in the database that will reinfect the site</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://github.com/extras-evolution/evocheck" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Evocheck</a> to check for malicious Plugins and files you wish to delete. Inside the source-code you will find strange / suspicious code seen below these instructions </li>
<li>Remember ID of this plugin, which is probably the last added one, and use phpMyAdmin or <a href="https://www.adminer.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.adminer.org/</a> to <strong>manually delete</strong> it from table &quot;site_plugins&quot;</li>
<li><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Repeat steps 4 + 5 just in case changes happened meanwhile</li>
<li><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: In cases the upgrade/security-fix seems not to work, there are additionally uploaded files / backdoors left on the server. Evocheck can help but still you need technical expertise to know what you are doing, i.e. using the right RegEx-terms to find malicious code. It is no one-click-solution!</li>
<li>If your site uses eForm or AjaxSearch on your site, test their functionality as there are changes to these Extras.</li>

This bug can affect MODx installations. MODx Revolution has been patched in GitHub for this. It is <strong>highly</strong> recommended that all MODx Revolution users patch their MODx installations with the fix made in this commit: <a href="https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/commit/3d8175c010374a3662fb86492fe7e808df0bae66" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/commit/3d8175c010374a3662fb86492fe7e808df0bae66</a> (do not copy the entire modx.class.php file, just the affected lines)<br />
<br />
To patch for Revolution, simply paste the following lines into the file &quot;core/model/modx/modx.class.php&quot; after line 30 (after the comments):<br />
<div class="dis-code"><pre class="brush: php; toolbar: false">if (strstr(str_replace('.','',serialize($_REQUEST)), '22250738585072011')) {

Installing it will patch your installation with a Plugin. (While the Plugin will work, MODX recommends patching the files if possible.)<br />
<br />
To patch for Evolution, simply add the above lines at the top of the &quot;manager/includes/protect.inc.php&quot; file.<br />
<br />
Since this is a PHP bug, and not a MODx bug, this will affect any and all MODx installations on server architecture that uses the x87 FPU and hasn’t forced SSE or float-store.<br />

<strong>LATE UPDATE:</strong><br />
<br />
The MODX Team has released Revolution 2.0.6-pl2 which adds a workaround for this PHP bug, as well as a couple other issues.
